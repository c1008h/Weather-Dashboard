## Project Description
    This is a weather dashboard that displays information about the weather of the city that the user inputs. It's great for traveling or planning to travel, or even just daily use to decide on what your outfit should be. 

## How to use the Weather Dashboard
    When the user opens up the weather dashboard they will be presented with a search bar. Once the user enters a city they wish to see more weather information about, the date, an image of the predicted weather, wind speed, uv, and humidity will pop up on the first box. On the bottom box, five other days after will display as well. 

    This weather dashboard also has a special feature that makes previous searched cities into buttons. Users can click this button to go back and see that city's information instead of having to type it out again.

    Another special feature that was added into this weather dashboard is the uv is highlighted depending on how dangerous the uv is on the current day. Green meaning it's favorable, yellow meaning it's moderate, and red meaning that it's severe. 

## Challenges
    Some challenges that I faced while coding this was getting the icon to display inside the divs. Once I figured out what was the problem it was easy to fix. But while trying to figure it out, it took forever.

    There were many small things that I typed wrong so it took a long time to see my own mistakes as well. 

    Trying to display the date was the hardest part because I didn't realize the api gave us the date. I was trying to loop through moments.js when I didn't need to.
